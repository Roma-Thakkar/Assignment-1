 <td>Myers-Briggs Test</td>
 <td> 67% of how I interact with the environment is extraverted. I am more of a social interaction than I am to myself. A gratitude survey expresses “89% of extraverts say they are comfortable verbally expressing gratitude when they feel it, compared to 67% of Introverts”. I’m the same. I like to express my gratitude towards someone as soon as I feel it. <br><br>My mental energy is from my views on what’s right and what’s wrong. I love to focus on hidden meaning and what the future holds for me therefore I possess 59% intuitive. Jean Luc Picard, Star Trek: The Next Generation  explicits “Things are only impossible until they’re not” which is my mentality. There are always way to turn things from impossible to possible. I may fail, but it will provide me more success to grow. <br><br>With my close ones I love to be with them in every feeling and I also love to express my feelings to them. 77% of my nature is from my feelings. “For those with the feeling trait, decisions tend to be based on the well-being of others” (16 personalities, para 11) illustrates the the kindness that I feel. For my loved ones, I am able to do anything for them to be happy. <br><br> 94% of me is judging to value the clarity, predictability and closure in preferring structure and planning. I love to planned and organised in my decision making. I judge only on the basis of getting better at things, exploring new things and getting to know one better. I love having goals that make me more motivated in what I do like a self motivation survey evokes “66% of those with the judging trait say they set specific goals that they hope to accomplish each day, compared to 34% of those with the prospecting trait.”<br> <br> 81% of me is assertive due to being resistant to stress. In any stress moments, I try my best to remain calm and positive. I am self assured that everything that happens will be for the best for me and even if it isn’t there will be lots to learn from them.  I “learn lessons from [my] personal [history], but they see little purpose in entertaining the same regrets again and again” My identity is to always to be confident in a calm manner.
