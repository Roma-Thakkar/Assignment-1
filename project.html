</div>
<div class="text">
      <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
      <p>The ‘Sportsnetic” app will enable local sports and schools to make use and share each sport scorecard.  Not only making your own design scorecard but having access to news and live scores of your favourite national sports and teams. Sportsnetic will remove manually having to write down scores and any necessary information and it can all be done electronically.  Each feature on the app will be function to make this app more efficient and effective for users to use. Scorecard will be programmed though MIT app inventor therefore having basic programmings skills are required. Sportsnetic can be a great benefit for coaches, referees and players in many ways. </p>
</div>
<div class ="textbox">
  <h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
  <p>There are lots of schools and local sports that continue to use a scorecard where thy have to manually write down all the scores and information for each sport. Even if the coach tells the players the scores, the players don’t seem to remember them as efficiently. Therefore, Sportsnetic will allow team members to have access to the results and can obtain general feedback from their coach. Coaches will not have to remember to bring a notepad and a pen, but only one device even if it is their phone to take the scores down. It will minimise time to take down it through just having to press buttons to get players name down and change the score.  Therefore, this application will help many people in different ways which make it useful and interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class ="paragraph">
  <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
  <p>Once the app opens up, the user will be able to view a news feed on categorised national sports. There is a small button (click here for more) that will allow the users to access the one hundred latest news for each sport. As soon as a new comment comes out, the one hundredth news post will not be accessible to the newsreader.<br><br>

There will be a sing-in and sign-up button on the top right.  When the user presses the button, two buttons will appear asking the user to sign-in or sign-up. There will be a hamburger on the top left-hand side which brings the menu to the screen and directs the user to different sections in the app. If the user hasn’t signed in, the button will not perched in bringing the menu upfront and will provide a message to sign in first. <br><br>

If the user clicks on the sign-in button, the user will enter their login. The password will be concealed with asterisks but will have a clickable eye if the user wants to see the password. Once the user has signed in once, it will have the option if they would like to use their face id to auto-fill their logins for them. If the user clicks on the sign-up button, an interface with a small form will come up. This form will clarify whether the player, organisation or staff member is part of a local sport or school. Whichever checklist is chosen, it will drop down another set of questions asking the user their local sports organisation or school name and whether they are a coach, head of sports, or a player. Then the form will proceed on getting demographic answers of the user and will allow the user to set their username and password. A database will store all the data provided by the user. Once the user has login in, each section on the menu will bee accessible. <br><br>

The first section is to make your scorecard. This section will allow local sports organisations and the head of sports department at school to originate their templates for each sport. The coaches and the head of sport will have access to a blank template and ready- made templates that they can edit. However, players can only access basic templates that they can use for training purposes. Once the template is in use, the players will be required to save, share and download it. However, it will not appear on the app if these actions have not occurred they will lose their scorecard. Making their template is not the only facility. The coach or the organisation head can set timers to remind the players that they are playing on what day and where they will be playing. <br><br>

The head of sports and coach can view their saved editable scorecards template for each sport under section two (Saved Templates). This section allows us to reduce the time to make each template again. They can use the same template for each game without editing the template. This section is only viewable for the head of sports and coaches. Players will only access the basic template in section one. <br><br>

The third section consists of local sporting facilities that local sports and schools can boom to conduct their fame or training. For each sport, numerous grounds stand listed with photographs. Once the picture clicks, the details will appear on the screen. This section consist of a filter option that will allow users to find a perfect stadium for their needs faster than ever. This filter option will include the location, sport, pricing, and facilities provided by the ground. <br><br>

The main section of the app is where each user will have access to the scorecard of their game. While the game is occurring, the coach or referee can edit the scorecard from this section. The scorecard will appear on this section one hour before the games commence and will remain there with results until the end of the day. The user can access completed games, matches at the moment and upcoming games by cling on all games on the top right of each sport category. While it will be editable by the coach, head of sport, or referee, the players will not have access to edit the scorecard. They will be able to see the scorecard and general feedback the coach has written in the notes section. Each user will have access to save, share and download the scorecard.Next to these buttons, there will be a camera where the head of sports can add pictures of the game that each user will have access to these photos. The photos presented will only be allowed to be viewed if the player in the frame is part of that local sports or schools team. If the opposition team players are viewable in the photo, it will be declined and prompted to remove this photo or to blur out the opposition before uploading. The same will occur id a player does not give permission for their photos uploaded on the app. Users will provide their consent when they sign-up, which can be changeable in the settings section. <br><br>

The next section will consist of live scores of international sports and news on these sports. This section can allow fans to view and engage in the national sport they support. There will be semi-permanent filter in this section, where users can click on which team and sport they would like to follow. Whatever selection the user has chosen will be seen in this section. For the non-selected team and sports, all the games and news are not viewable for the user, This filter will not change each time unless the user changes their selection.<br><br>

The final section is the setting where the user can control their profile and features of the app. The user can changer its display whether they want it in light or dark mode. If the user chooses light, the default colours will be blue and white also the majority of the text to be in black. However, the default colours of the dark mode are blue and black. Only the head of sports or local sports organisation can change the default blue colour for their organisation or schools colours which will be viable by the players. Each user will have access to change their details and passwords if they choose to.<br><br>

      <h4><b>Tools and Technology</b></h4>
      <p>Software required of this application is app development software which is MIT app inventor and SQLite for the database to store the personal information. SQLite is a high version of relational database model which deals with small data with unfrequent changes. The user will not be changing their details frequently therefore there is no requirement of having higher database model. MIT app inventor will help to make the application which can be accessible on android or Mac operating system.  An application server and graphics will be required as well as a central processing unit as the applications hardware. The application will need to have an iOS 9.0 or later if an iPhone or iPad is being used. If you want to access the Sportsnetic on an android operating device you will require 2.1 Eclair or higher Android devices. If the scorecard is being accessed on you Mac it needs to be macOS 11 or higher with Apple M1 silicon. Windows will need Windows XP, Window Vista, Windows 7 to have the Sportsnetic working to its best capabilities </p>
