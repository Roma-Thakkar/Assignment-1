    <p>Hey I’m Roma and one of my hobbies is watching cricket. I’m a big fan of Steven Smith in the Australian cricket team also known as one of the top batsmen in the world. I was born in Melbourne and I am have been raised in three homes which two to be in Pascoe-Vale and my current home being in Craigieburn.</p>


    <p>I’m nationally a loyal Australian citizen and I am raised in the Indian culture as both my parents are from the largest city of Gujarat, Ahmedabad in India. </p>

    <p>I have accomplished my school years in 2021 and in 2022 I have commenced my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. I have undertaken User-centred Design, Introduction to Programming, Introduction to Information Technology and Practical Database Concepts  in semester 1, 2022. I currently plan on taking a masters degree either in cybersecurity or information technology once a have finished my bachelors degree in three years time.</p>

    <p>My fluent languages I know is English, Gujarati and Hindi. I also know a little bit of French. Apart from my most favourite hobby, I also love to spend time with my friends.</p>
