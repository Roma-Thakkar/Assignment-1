      <h4><b>What is my interest in IT?</b></h4>
      <p>  Information Technology is so broad that I cannot be bored of it. There are a variety of aspects that can be placed under the title of Information Technology including cybersecurity, software development, augmented reality and etc.<br><br> Being able to do something new each project or each every few months caught my interest in Information Technology. I personally get bored for doing the same thing over and over. So being able to use the same skills and knowledge on a new subject time to time helps to remove the boredom of doing one thing each day. <br><br>The skills and knowledge that I have gained from one project may not be sufficient enough to accomplish another project which means I will have to learn more to accomplish the problem that has arisen. Having the opportunity to be able to different things and being able to learn new thing each day is my interest in Information Technology. <br><br> Today, there is nothing where Information Technology is not involved so I want to learn about the backhand of this technology world as it is in our everyday world. </p>

      <h4><b>When did my interest in IT start?</b></h4>
      <p>In 2018, I had taken my first IT electives and I had really enjoyed doing the programming, exercises that we were supposed to do. I was really enjoying the electives that  I was inpatient with waiting for those classes to occur.<br><br> Since then I have continued to take an IT elective in year 10 and also took applied computing in year 11 and 12. In year 11 and 12 I was the only girl in the class that was participating in this subject. I may not be the greatest to learn the theory component of the content but I was always fluent with my practical skills.</p>

      <h4><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</b></h4>
      <p>One of my electives in 2018 was programming in html. My teacher provide so many resources to help guide to learn the necessary code and provided exactly what we need to do allowed me to enjoy the subject.<br><br> In particular, I love programming. I always wondered how do these software, websites and apps created and today I have learnt a few programming languages that I can spend all my time programming.<br><br> In my elective of coding html in 2018, I accidentally had typed something which made a strike through the text in the paragraph and I was struggling to find where and how I made this to occur. Therefore, I had asked my teacher for help and while debugging the program the problem of the strike occurring over text came upfront. Thus, I had taught my teacher something new as she was not aware of this code before this incident.<br><br> So, this made me like the idea of filling missing skills and knowledge through others skills. When we share our skills and knowledge with each other, we are able to learn more than working on your own. </p>
