    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <h4><b>What is my interest in IT?</b></h4>
      <p>  Information Technology is so broad that I cannot be bored of it. There are a variety of aspects that can be placed under the title of Information Technology including cybersecurity, software development, augmented reality and etc.<br><br> Being able to do something new each project or each every few months caught my interest in Information Technology. I personally get bored for doing the same thing over and over. So being able to use the same skills and knowledge on a new subject time to time helps to remove the boredom of doing one thing each day. <br><br>The skills and knowledge that I have gained from one project may not be sufficient enough to accomplish another project which means I will have to learn more to accomplish the problem that has arisen. Having the opportunity to be able to do different things and being able to learn new thing each day is my interest in Information Technology. <br><br> Today, there is nothing where Information Technology is not involved so I want to learn about the backhand of this technology world as it is in our everyday world. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textbox">
      <h4><b>When did my interest in IT start?</b></h4>
      <p>In 2018, I had taken my first IT electives and I had really enjoyed doing the programming, exercises that we were supposed to do. I was really enjoying the electives that  I was inpatient with waiting for those classes to occur.<br><br> Since then I have continued to take an IT elective in year 10 and also took applied computing in year 11 and 12. In year 11 and 12 I was the only girl in the class that was participating in this subject. I may not be the greatest to learn the theory component of the content but I was always fluent with my practical skills.</p>

    <div class="question3">
      <h4><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</b></h4>
      <p>One of my electives in 2018 was programming in html. My teacher provide so many resources to help guide to learn the necessary code and provided exactly what we need to do allowed me to enjoy the subject.<br><br> In particular, I love programming. I always wondered how do these software, websites and apps are created and today I have learnt a few programming languages that I can spend all my time programming.<br><br> In my elective of coding html in 2018, I accidentally had typed something which made a strike through the text in the paragraph and I was struggling to find where and how I made this to occur. Therefore, I had asked my teacher for help and while debugging the program the problem of the strike occurring over the text came upfront. Thus, I had taught my teacher something new as she was not aware of this code before this incident.<br><br> So, this made me like the idea of filling missing skills and knowledge through others skills. When we share our skills and knowledge with each other, we are able to learn more than working on your own. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question4">
      <h4><b>Outline of my IT experience </b></h4>
      <p>Throughout my school years I have learned a few programming languages. I have learnt html, basics of python and visual basic.<br><br> I had accomplished my grade 12 SAT which was to do a whole software development project using visual basics. I also have used tools like scratch 2 to makes mini games and to learn the common factors of programming.<br><br> Not only my programming skills have improved through my school years but also other factors including using other applications for other topics like databases, networking and the basics. <br><br>Throughout grade 11, I had completed databases, programming and networking which allowed me to give an idea of a few fields within information technology. I learned how to make databases in Microsoft Access and I also got to expand my skills in using Microsoft Excel. <br><br>Apart from my school studies, I do not hold any information technology experience. </p>

    <div class="question5">
      <h4><b>Why did I choose to come to RMIT? </b></h4>
      <p>I choose to come to RMIT for a number of factors.<br><br> Firstly, travelling to the city campus of RMIT has a straight forward route and it doesn’t require to change many public transport like it would if I have gone to another university.<br><br> Secondly, RMIT provided me better options for doing a bachelor’s degree related to IT and computing. Other university was not providing much opportunities to get a variety to the information technology field therefore RMIT was the best option for me to explore my skills and expand my knowledge.<br><br> Thirdly, I had received many recommendations from family and family friends that RMIT is the best university to do technology based studies. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="question6">
      <h4><b>What do I expect to learn during your studies? </b></h4>
      <p>In my studies I expect that I get to learn a variety of new skills and knowledge throughout as many fields in Information Technology.<br><br> I would like to study a variety of fields to have flexibility and have expansion in my knowledge instead of being too directed in one field as each field in information technology is interconnected with each other.<br><br> In particular, I would love to spend time learning different programming languages and also learn more into cybersecurity. I would like to do programming as it has been something that I have enjoyed in the past which I do want to continue to do into the future.<br><br> Cybersecurity is something that I am not too familiar with but I have got a lot of recommendations on doing it to help me expand my professional growth so I would like to know more about this field.</p>
